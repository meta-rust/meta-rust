# Naming explanation
# Yocto
# - BUILD_SYS - Yocto triple of the build environment
# - HOST_SYS - What we're building for in Yocto
# - TARGET_SYS - What we're building for in Yocto
#
# So when building '-native' packages BUILD_SYS == HOST_SYS == TARGET_SYS
# When building packages for the image HOST_SYS == TARGET_SYS
# This is a gross over simplification as there are other modes but
# currently this is all that's supported.
#
# Rust
# - TARGET - the system where the binary will run
# - HOST - the system where the binary is being built
#
# Rust additionally will use two additional cases:
# - undecorated (e.g. CC) - equivalent to TARGET
# - triple suffix (e.g. CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu) - both
#   see: https://github.com/alexcrichton/gcc-rs
# The way that Rust's internal triples and Yocto triples are mapped together
# its likely best to not use the triple suffix due to potential confusion.
